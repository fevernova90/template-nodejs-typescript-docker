# Starter for typescript Nodejs with Docker

A starter template for nodejs with typescript enabled and docker-contained

## Important files require changes specific to your needs

- deploy-\*.sh
- Dockerfile
- package.json (duh)

Other files can be straight away deploy/test and add your routes for ExpressJs as required.
